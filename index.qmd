# Project Aims

Using latent change score models (lcsm), examine the associations between:

1.  change in tau on change in pacc

2.  change in pacc on change in tau

3.  cross-sectional tau on change in pacc

4.  cross-sectional pacc on change in tau

We will test these associations while covarying for baseline age, sex, years of education, and APOEe4 status.
